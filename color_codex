This is the most recent version of color codex. This game is playing by using the arrow keys to get to the yellow squares, which is the objective while also avoiding the black squares, which send you back to the start. There are also squares of different colors, which apply different effects on the square that you control such as increased/slowed speed or decreasing the opacity of the square, making it harder to see.
